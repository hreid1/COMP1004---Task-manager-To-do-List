# COMP1004 Project 2024 - Task manager/To-do List

This is my COMP1004 project - Henry Reid

## Description

The Task Manager/to-do list allows users to input tasks along with their due dates, priorities, and categories.
Users can then add these tasks to a list of uncompleted tasks and when completed those tasks get automatically moved to the completed tasks section.

## Usage

To use the Task Manager:

1. Open the folder labeled 'EndOfYear'
2. Open the 'index.html' file in your web browser
3. Input the task title, due date, priority, and category in the necessary boxes
4. Click the 'Add Task' button to add the task to the list of uncompleted task section
5. From there the task is displayed on the screen with the necessary information and is saved to the local json storage so that if the page is refreshed or accessed again, the tasks will stay
6. You can then have the ability to delete, edit and checkmark tasks

## File structure

- 'index.html': Contains the layout of the Task Manager web application
- 'styles.css': A stylesheet for formatting the appearance of the web application
- 'script.js': A Javascript file containing the logic for adding, storing and managing the task lists.
